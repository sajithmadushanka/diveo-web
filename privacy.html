        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 29, 2025</p>

        <p>
            Diveo (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy

        <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            Diveo may display advertisements provided by third-party advertising services
            such as Google AdMob.
        </p>
        <p>
            These services may collect and use non-personal information (for example,
            device identifiers or approximate location) to provide and measure ads, in
            accordance with their own privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diveo does not control how third-party advertisers collect or use this data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Analytics and Game Services</h2>
        <p>
            Diveo may use third-party analytics tools to better understand how players
            interact with the game. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymous and is
            used only to improve the game experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diveo may also use platform services such as Apple Game Center or Google Play
            Games Services for leaderboards. These services are operated by their
            respective platform providers and are subject to their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>

            the app.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>

            encourage you to review.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
